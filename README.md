This repositary contains two files namely benchmark and Adversarial IDS
In benchmark file, two datasets are called and preprocessed namely, KDDCUP'99 and Kitsune MIM dataset
In Adversarial IDS, the code for the calling of adversarial attacks from cleverhans library and defense against such attacks is implemented

To run the code, open anaconda prompt and write
"streamlit run *Adversarial IDS file with directory saved locally*"

After running this command streamlit would open up in a browser and would show default set results
On the left side of the page there are multiple dropdown options from which you can select any according to your needs and the result would be displayed on the right side of the browser screen
